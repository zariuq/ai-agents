# Projective Credal Systems

This module isolates the shared finite-to-infinite abstraction behind two
threads:

* Walley natural extension: compatible local assessments induce a conservative
  lower envelope over global completions.
* Infinite MLN/Gibbs semantics: compatible finite-dimensional marginals define
  a projective family of possible global completions.

The file deliberately proves the envelope and compatibility laws that are
available without functional-analysis compactness.  Full inverse-limit
existence is a later theorem: here nonemptiness is an explicit hypothesis or a
concrete global completion.

Terminology matches Walley's lower-prevision presentation: natural extension is
modeled as a lower envelope of compatible precise previsions, the shared base is
finite-additive/functional, and σ-additivity/conglomerability are refinement
axes rather than hidden assumptions.

/-! ## Bounded measurable observable carrier -/

/-- A bounded measurable gamble: the honest σ-additive observable carrier.

The base Walley layer keeps `Gamble Ω = Ω → ℝ` as a finite-additive functional
domain.  Measure-theoretic previsions require a smaller domain: measurable
bounded observables.  This structure is the carrier that future weak*/compact
and σ-additive adapters should target. -/

/-! ### A raw-extension obstruction

The raw Walley carrier `Gamble Ω = Ω → ℝ` is intentionally larger than the
bounded-measurable carrier.  The following countable canary shows why a
σ-additive bounded-observable prevision cannot be blindly promoted to a
finite-valued precise prevision on all raw gambles: even the geometric law on
`ℕ` would force the unbounded gamble `n ↦ 2^(n+1)` to have expectation at least
every finite number.

/-- Raw strict credal width on a bounded measurable observable has Walley
dominating endpoint completions for the bounded-measurable natural extension

Walley's envelope theorem says that a coherent lower prevision is the lower
envelope of its dominating precise previsions.  The theorem below uses the
algebraic Hahn-Banach theorem already imported by the imprecise-probability base:
for each gamble, there is a dominating precise prevision touching the lower
prevision at that gamble.
