# FCA Recovery for Exact Concept Formation

This module makes explicit that the exact finite concept-formation surface is
not a parallel notion beside classical FCA: it is equivalent to mathlib's
formal-concept carrier for the same gated incidence relation.

That equivalence is the main conceptual reason the classical FCA algorithms and
order-theoretic results remain the right exact baseline for our theory.
