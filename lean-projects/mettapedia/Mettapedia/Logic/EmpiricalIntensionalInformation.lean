# Empirical Intensional Information for Concept-Membership Events

This file gives a concrete finite model for Chapter-12-style reasoning over a
binary membership table:

- feature absent / present
- witness absent / present

It deliberately keeps two different objects side by side:

1. the **pointwise log-ratio score** for the update `P(W | F)` versus `P(W)`
2. the **Shannon mutual information** of the whole 2×2 joint table
