# Source Reliability Model (Dawid-Skene Layer)

The MODEL (not the EM algorithm) for source-specific reliability:
each evidence source has an accuracy profile that determines how much
its contributions should be trusted.

## Design (council consensus)

This is EvidentialLedger Layer 2: the reliability layer that sits
ABOVE the additive evidence composition (Layer 1). It does NOT
replace additive aggregation — it ADJUSTS the contributions before
they enter the additive fold.

Key separation (Dawid & Skene 1979):
- Layer 1 (EvidentialLedger): aggregate → evidence
- Layer 2 (this file): reliability → adjusted evidence → aggregate

## What This File Does

1. Defines `ReliabilityProfile`: per-source accuracy (tp_rate, tn_rate)
2. Defines `reliabilityAdjust`: scale evidence by accuracy
3. Proves: perfect accuracy preserves, zero accuracy zeroes, monotonicity
4. Defines `defaultReliability`: EvidenceKind-dependent priors

## What This File Does NOT Do

- EM algorithm for learning reliability from data (future work)
- Confusion matrices or Rasch models (more complex reliability models)
- Integration with `WeightedSourceItem` (already have `weight : Nat`)

/-- Per-source reliability profile.
    `tpRate` = P(source reports + | truth is +) (sensitivity)
    `tnRate` = P(source reports − | truth is −) (specificity)
    Both in [0, 1000] (× 1000 encoding for kernel-checkable arithmetic). -/

  tpRate : Nat  -- true positive rate × 1000 (1000 = perfect)

/-- Perfect reliability: source always reports correctly. -/
def perfectProfile : ReliabilityProfile := ⟨1000, 1000, 0⟩

/-- Uninformative profile: source reports randomly. -/
def uninformativeProfile : ReliabilityProfile := ⟨500, 500, 0⟩

/-- Zero reliability: source always reports opposite. -/
def invertedProfile : ReliabilityProfile := ⟨0, 0, 0⟩

/-! ## 3. Reliability adjustment -/

/-- Adjust raw evidence by source reliability.
    Positive evidence scaled by true positive rate.
    Negative evidence scaled by true negative rate. -/

/-! ## 5. EvidenceKind-dependent default reliability

Different epistemic kinds get different default reliability priors.
Empirical evidence (checkLang, data) gets high default reliability.
Expert-elicited gets moderate. Model-derived and text-interpreted
get lower defaults. -/

def defaultReliability : EvidenceKind → ReliabilityProfile
  | .empirical         => ⟨950, 950, 50⟩   -- high: data-backed
  | .expertElicited    => ⟨800, 800, 10⟩   -- moderate: structured judgment
  | .modelDerived      => ⟨700, 700, 5⟩    -- lower: model may be miscalibrated
  | .textInterpreted   => ⟨600, 600, 2⟩    -- low: human interpretation of text
  | .logicalDerivation => ⟨900, 900, 20⟩   -- high: formal entailment

/-- Empirical evidence has higher default reliability than text-interpreted. -/
