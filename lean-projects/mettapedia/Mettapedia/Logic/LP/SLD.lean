# Logic Programming Kernel: SLD Resolution

SLD (Selective Linear Definite clause) resolution for logic programs.

## Scope

SLD resolution is formalized for **full first-order LP** — no function-free
restriction. The `SLDTree` type and `SLDTree_sound` theorem work with
compound terms including nested function symbol applications.

## Design

- `Grounding.compSubst` — composition of a grounding with a substitution,
  yielding a new grounding. Key bridge between SLD steps and model theory.
- `SLDTree prog goals θ` — big-step SLD refutation tree (leftmost selection).
  An SLD refutation reduces goals to empty via clause resolution steps.
- `SLDTree_sound` — soundness: if there is a refutation with computed answer θ,
  then every goal atom, grounded via θ and any further grounding, is in the
  least Herbrand model (Lloyd's Soundness Theorem, FLP Theorem 3.1).
- Variable freshening is not formalized; the standard "standardized apart"
  convention is assumed at each resolution step.

/-! ## Section 2: SLD derivation trees -/

/-- SLD refutation tree (big-step, leftmost selection rule).

    `SLDTree prog goals θ` means there is an SLD refutation of `← goals`
    using clauses from `prog`, with computed answer substitution `θ`.

    At each step, the leftmost goal atom is selected, unified with a clause
    head, and replaced by the (substituted) clause body. The computed answer
    is the composition of all unifiers.

    **Variable freshening**: This definition assumes clauses are appropriately
    renamed at each step (standard "standardized apart" convention from Lloyd).
    Soundness holds regardless of freshening. -/

      the substituted clause body prepended to the remaining goals. -/

/-! ## Section 3: Soundness -/

/-- **Soundness of SLD resolution** (Lloyd, FLP Theorem 3.1):
    if there is an SLD refutation of `← goals` with computed answer `θ`,
    then for any grounding `g`, every goal atom grounded via `g ∘ θ`
    is in the least Herbrand model.

    Formally: `(g.compSubst θ).groundAtom a ∈ leastHerbrandModel kb`
    for every `a ∈ goals`. -/
