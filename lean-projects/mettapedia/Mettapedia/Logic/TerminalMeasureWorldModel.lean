# Terminal Measure-Valued World Model (Step A: Finite Query Spaces)

Every additive world model over a finite query space induces a discrete
measure. This is the first concrete bridge between the WM algebra and
`MeasureTheory.Measure` — the Tier 3 research frontier.

## Construction

For finite `Query` with `BinaryEvidence` carrier:

    μ_W = ∑ q : Query, (extract W q).total • Measure.dirac q

The terminal property: `μ_{W₁ + W₂} = μ_{W₁} + μ_{W₂}` — the measure
construction is an additive monoid homomorphism from states to measures.

## Why "terminal"

The measure-valued WM is the universal completion: every concrete carrier
(binary, Dirichlet, NormalGamma) embeds into measures via its `.total`
function. The evidence profile `Query → Ev` maps to a measure on `Query`
weighted by total evidence at each query point. The additive extraction
law ensures this respects revision.

## Scope

Step A: finite query spaces (discrete measures via Finset.sum + Dirac). DONE.
Step B: countable queries via Measure.sum + Dirac. DONE.
Step C (future): measurable queries via σ-algebras.
