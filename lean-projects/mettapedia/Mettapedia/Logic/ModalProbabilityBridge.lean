# Modal ↔ Probability Bridge: WM Regimes as Probability Vertices

Maps each WM regime to a specific vertex in the 13-axis probability
hypercube. This connects the 2-axis KS classification (logic × representation)
from `WMHypercubeClassification.lean` to the full 13-axis probability
classification from `Hypercube/Basic.lean`.

## The Bridge

The 2-axis KS hypercube (Boolean/Heyting × Point/Bounds) determines
4 of the 13 probability axes:
- Commutativity: always commutative (WM uses AddCommMonoid)
- Distributivity: Boolean → boolean lattice, Heyting → distributive lattice
- Precision: Point → precise, Bounds → imprecise
- Determinism: always probabilistic (not deterministic or fuzzy)

The remaining 9 axes are set to the WM calculus defaults:
- Ordering: partial (evidence carriers have incomparable states)
- Density: nondense (BinEvNat is discrete)
- Completeness: incomplete (for Nat carriers; complete for ℝ≥0∞)
- Separation: ksSeparation (proven in the KS formalization)
- Additivity: derived (from KS axioms)
- Invertibility: monoid (zero + addition, no subtraction required)
- Support: finite (for kernel-checked demos; countable for LP lift)
- Regularity: finitelyAdditive (Steps A/B; Borel for Step C)
- Independence: boolean (tensor = coordinatewise multiplication)
