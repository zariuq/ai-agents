# WM Order-Cost Audit Certificates

Bridge from runtime-facing order checks to theorem-level schedule budgets.

This module provides small certificate theorems:

- pairwise runtime difference checks certify `scheduleErrorBound`,
- threshold monotonicity promotes certified bounds to policy thresholds,
- swap-step checks certify the corresponding two-step schedule policy.
