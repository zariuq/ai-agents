# RavenAsymmetricInduction — learning "ravens are black", *not* "black things are ravens"

A WM-PLN-solid worked example of the directional asymmetry of inductive
inheritance (Hempel's raven paradox dissolved *dynamically*).

Induction is modeled as iterated **revision** (`revision = (+)` on
`BinaryEvidence`, the WM-calculus evidence-addition operation). Each observation
contributes one unit of evidence:

* **`raven → black`** — every observed raven is black, so each raven contributes
  `pos = 1`, `neg = 0`. After `R` ravens the evidence is `⟨R, 0⟩` and the strength
  is `R / R = 1`.
* **`black → raven`** — among black things, ravens are positive and black
  non-ravens are negative. After `R` black ravens and `M` black non-ravens the
  evidence is `⟨R, M⟩` and the strength is `R / (R + M)`, which **decays toward
  the base rate** as the number `M` of *other black items* grows.

The *same* observations feed both links; the asymmetry is purely a matter of
which count each observation lands in — exactly the base-rate dilution of the
inverse conditional. Crucially, `black → raven` is *well-evidenced* (total
`R + M` grows with `M`): we become *confident* that black things are mostly
*not* ravens.

This file gives both:

* a **dataset-level** presentation using finite lists of observations and
  iterated revision, showing the result depends only on the two sufficient
  counts;
* the familiar **closed-form** `R/M` presentation as a corollary.

`sorry`-free, `axiom`-free.
