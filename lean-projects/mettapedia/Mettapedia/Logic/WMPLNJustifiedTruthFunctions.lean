# WM-PLN Justified Truth Functions

This file records the strongest theorem-backed truth-value formulas and
conservative scalar bounds currently available in the Lean WM-PLN development.

Interpretation:

* "Exact" means backed by explicit world-model / BinaryEvidence / probability
  bridge theorems already in the development.
* "Conservative" means the scalar confidence formula is justified as a safe
  lower bound or safe bounded aggregator, but not yet proved uniquely canonical.
* Heuristic OpenCog/PeTTa extras that lack a theorem path are intentionally
  omitted from this file.

Quick map for readers:

* Exact WM-backed TV rules in this file:
  - `truthRevision`
  - `truthInduction`
  - `truthAbduction`
  - `truthNegation`
* Conservative scalar TV rules in this file:
  - `truthDeductionConservative`
  - `truthModusPonensConservative`
  - `truthSymmetricModusPonensConservative`
* Additional WM-backed TV surfaces not present in current upstream PeTTa main:
  - `truthPredictiveImplicationConservative`
  - `truthConjunctionConditionalConservative`
  - `truthConjunctionIndependentEvidenceStyle`
  - `truthConjunctionHypergeometric`
* Distribution-backed WM view families live in:
  - `Mettapedia.Logic.WMPLNDistributionalTruthFunctions`
* Formal comparison against PeTTa and canonical upstream lives in:
  - `Mettapedia.Logic.PeTTaLibPLNFormalAnalysis`

Design note:

* Conjunction is currently kept regime-explicit rather than collapsed into a
  single overloaded `truthConjunction`. The present file exposes the
  conditional/product, independent/evidence-style, and hypergeometric/modal
  regimes separately because they answer different semantic questions.

## Reading this file if you are not a Lean user

The *story* lives in (i) section headers, (ii) theorem and definition
names, and (iii) their plain-English docstrings (`/-- ... -/`). Proof
bodies — the blocks starting with `by` — are machine verification and
can be skipped on first read.

Lean syntax you will see:

* `TV.s`, `TV.c` are accessor dot-notation; for a truth value `t`,
  `t.s` is its strength and `t.c` its confidence.
* `Set.Icc a b` is the closed interval `[a, b]`; appears as in-range
  hypotheses on inputs.
* `theorem foo : … := by …` is a claim followed by its proof. The
  claim is everything before `:=`; the proof lives after `by` and can
  be skipped.
* `noncomputable def` introduces a real-valued function defined via
  classical reals; semantically identical to a PLN/MeTTa formula, just
  not kernel-executable.
* Anonymous-constructor `⟨a, b⟩` builds a pair / structure value; e.g.
  `⟨0.7, 0.9⟩` for a TV with strength 0.7 and confidence 0.9.

PLN-adjacent auxiliary symbols used throughout:

* `MAX_CONF = 0.9999` — the hard confidence cap (a confidence of 1 is
  disallowed so that more evidence can always raise it).
* `c2w c = c / (1 - c)` — confidence → evidence weight.
* `w2c w = w / (w + 1)` — evidence weight → confidence (inverse of
  `c2w`).
* `capConf c = max 0 (min c MAX_CONF)` — clip into `[0, MAX_CONF]`.

**The running story.** The exact induction/abduction confidence currently
used here is `w2c (min (c2w cBA) (c2w cBC))`: the min is taken in weight
space, then converted back. A theorem in this file
(`truthInduction_conf_eq_min_capped`) proves that this round-trip
equals `min (capConf cBA) (capConf cBC)` — the intuitive "your chained
confidence is the weaker of your two inputs'".

The historical raw-min formula `w2c (min cBA cBC)` is analyzed in
`Mettapedia.Logic.PLNBugAnalysis`; it double-damps by treating a
confidence as if it were already an evidence weight.

/-- **Headline theorem: the weight-space detour collapses.** The
WM-corrected induction confidence is just the smaller of the two input
confidences, after each has been clipped to `[0, MAX_CONF]`. In
symbols: `w2c (min (c2w cBA) (c2w cBC)) = min (capConf cBA) (capConf cBC)`.

Intuition: go into weight space, take the min, come back — the detour
cancels. The weight-space transform is not adding anything fancy; it is
exactly the right wrapper to make the obvious answer come out.

**Numeric example.** For `cBA = 0.5, cBC = 0.7`, both `capConf` calls
are the identity, so this theorem gives `min(0.5, 0.7) = 0.5` — "your
chained confidence equals your weakest input's." The historical raw-min
bug computed `Truth_w2c (min cBA cBC) = w2c(0.5) = 0.5 / 1.5 = 1/3 ≈
0.333` instead by feeding a raw confidence back into `w2c` as if it were
a weight. -/

/-! ## Constructive WM-facing strength analogues for non-core mirrored rules

The mirrored PeTTa/OpenCog-style rules below are not promoted as fully justified
truth-value rules yet, but the Lean development already contains stronger formal
analogues for their *strength* components.  These are the constructive WM-facing
surfaces that the comparison file can use.

The reasons they stay out of the fully justified TV layer are not uniform:

* `truthInversion` splits into two formally meaningful variants:
  the compiled-rule-catalog strength keeps `s_BA = s_AB`, while the
  Bayes-inversion strength is the quantity used internally by
  induction/abduction derivations.  The mirrored library confidence is still a
  damped heuristic (`0.6 * ...`).
* `truthEquivalenceToImplication` is very close to `sim2inh` away from the
  threshold hack, but the mirrored TV rule still hard-codes the threshold.
* `truthTransitiveSimilarity` already matches the formal similarity-composition
  strength, while confidence remains only conservative.
* `truthEvaluationImplication` reuses a deduction-style strength core, but the
  confidence is still a hand-tuned attenuation heuristic.

/-- **Standalone / catalog inversion strength.** In this reading, the
inverted implication keeps the same strength as the original:
`s_BA = s_AB`. This matches the compiled rule-catalog form and is
under-parameterized for Bayes inversion — it does not depend on
`P(A)` or `P(B)`. -/
noncomputable def truthInversionStrength (ab : TV) : ℝ :=
  ab.s

/-- **Bayes inversion strength.** The full probabilistic reading:
`s_BA = P(A|B) = P(B|A) · P(A) / P(B) = s_AB · s_A / s_B`. This is the
quantity used internally by induction/abduction derivations, and it
disagrees with `truthInversionStrength` in general (see the
counterexample `truthInversion_catalog_ne_bayes_example` in the
analysis file). -/

/-- Strength analogue for the mirrored equivalence-to-implication rule.
Drops the mirror's 0.99 threshold branch and identifies the underlying
transformation with `sim2inh` (similarity → inheritance), whose strength
formula comes out of the Chapter-6 probability reading. -/
noncomputable def truthEquivalenceToImplicationStrength (a b ab : TV) : ℝ :=
  Mettapedia.Logic.PLNInferenceRules.sim2inh ab.s a.s b.s

/-- Strength analogue for the mirrored transitive-similarity rule.
Delegates to the formal similarity-composition formula from
`PLNInferenceRules`; the corresponding confidence is still only a
conservative minimum-style aggregator in the mirror, so this covers the
strength half only. -/
noncomputable def truthTransitiveSimilarityStrength (a b c ab bc : TV) : ℝ :=
  Mettapedia.Logic.PLNInferenceRules.transitiveSimilarity ab.s bc.s a.s b.s c.s

/-- Strength analogue for the mirrored evaluation-implication rule.
Strips the mirror's `0.9 * 0.9 * …` confidence-attenuation heuristic and
exposes just the deduction-strength formula that is the proper formal
core. Confidence remains a hand-tuned heuristic in the mirror and is not
promoted to a theorem-backed quantity here. -/
