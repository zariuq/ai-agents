# Empirical Intensional Information ↔ Tiny Factor-Graph Bridge

This file closes the smallest concrete loop between the regrounded inheritance
surface and the factor-graph / belief-propagation stack.

For a single empirical 2x2 `MembershipCounts` table, we build the corresponding
one-factor Boolean factor graph and prove that:

* exact VE constraint weights recover the table counts;
* the inherited probabilities are read as exact ratios of those weights;
* the corresponding BP messages and factor belief recover the same local counts.
