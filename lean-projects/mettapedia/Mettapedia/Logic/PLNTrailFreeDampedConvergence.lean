# Damped SP/SPN Dynamics with Fresh-Evidence Convergence

This module adds a positive Chapter-9 counterpart to the trail-free non-convergence
counterexample:

- `spStep`: unstable trail-free update (`toggle`),
- `spnStep`: fresh-evidence injection update,
- `dampedSPNStep`: damped blend using a freshness gate,
- constructive convergence theorem on finite state (`Bool`) under eventual fresh evidence.
