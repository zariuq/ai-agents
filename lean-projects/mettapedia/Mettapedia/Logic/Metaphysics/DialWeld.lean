# The dial weld: one dial across the ultrafilter, concept, and world layers

The open/closed-world dial appears in three vocabularies across the library. This file
proves they are the **same dial**:

* **Concept layer = ultrafilter layer.** A concept is open-world in the credal sense
  (`openWorldConcept`, membership in the scrutability gap) **iff** its gate-verdict
  family is `OpenFamily` (`openWorldConcept_iff_openFamily`); it is That's-All **iff**
  the family is `PreciseFamily` (`thatsAllConcept_iff_preciseFamily`) — Codex's
  concept-state dial and the ultrainfinitist perspectival dial are provably one.
* **Finite evidence = principal shadows.** Over a finite index every ultrafilter is
  principal (`Ultrafilter.eq_pure_of_finite`), so every perspective on a finite gate
  family is some gate's own verdict (`ultraTrue_of_finite`). Together with the
  finite-stage atomicity of frontiers
  (`Mettapedia.Foundations.Gunk.not_isGunky_of_finite`), this is the theorem-pair form
  of "the finite is the principal shadow": **finite frontier ⟹ atomic; finite
  perspectives ⟹ all principal**. Gunk and free perspectives both live only in the
  limit.
* **World layer.** Every nontrivial Boolean world is a mereology
  (`BAWorld.toMereology`), and gunkiness transports definitionally, so the Cantor
  witness serves the Sider argument and the two-semantics theorem at once.

/-- Over a finite index, every perspective is a coordinate's own verdict: the finite
has only principal shadows. (Companion to `Gunk.not_isGunky_of_finite`: finite
frontiers are atomic, finite perspective-spaces are principal — gunk and freedom both
need the limit.) -/
