Paper-facing maximality interfaces for Henkin p. 86.

Henkin's first move after Theorem 1 is to enlarge the starting closed theory to
a maximal consistent one: every omitted closed formula makes the enlarged set
inconsistent.  The trusted HOL core does not construct such a theory directly,
but the consequence of maximality can still be formalized cleanly on top of the
existing closed-theory interface.
