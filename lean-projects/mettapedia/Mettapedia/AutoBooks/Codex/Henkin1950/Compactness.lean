Narrow theorem-facing compactness consequences for Henkin (1950).

The full reverse direction of Theorem 3 still depends on the remaining bridge
from the currently surfaced model theory to the exact proof system and
consistency notion used in the paper. This file currently packages the trusted
HOL-side finite-theory derivability and consistency notions that a future
reverse-side compactness theorem will need.

signature. -/

/-- Any finite-theory derivation in the raw trusted HOL proof system also gives
set-based provability in the extensional closed-theory system. This is the
proof-theoretic bridge from the weaker `Derivation` packaging used for
soundness to the stronger closed-theory notion underlying `Consistent`. -/

smaller trusted HOL derivation system. This isolates one honest reverse-side
compactness prerequisite without overclaiming the full semantic converse of
Theorem 3. -/

no finite closed subtheory derives falsity in the raw HOL derivation system. -/

/-- Theorem 3 forward corollary at the currently trusted proof-system layer:
any closed theory satisfiable in a paper-general model is already consistent
against finite derivations of falsity in the raw HOL derivation system. -/

if a closed theory finitely derives falsity in the raw HOL proof system, it
cannot be satisfiable in a paper-general model. -/

  intro hT hSat

/-- The same obstruction already appears one step earlier: if the trusted HOL
finite-derivation notion finds a contradiction, then the theory cannot even
have all of its finite closed subtheories satisfiable in paper-general models.

    {T : ClosedTheorySet} :
    ¬ DerivationConsistent T → ¬ FiniteSubsetSatisfiable T := by
  intro hT hFin
  exact hT (derivationConsistent_of_finiteSubsetSatisfiable hFin)

/-- The paper-facing consistency notion is also obstructed by any finite
derivation of falsity in the raw trusted HOL proof system. This is the direct
contrapositive companion to `derivationConsistent_of_consistent`. -/

/-- Theorem 3 forward reaches the paper-facing extensional consistency notion
once the current paper-general model class is strengthened by a uniform
`EqAppArgSound` hypothesis. This is the honest compactness-level corollary of
the new extensional soundness layer. -/
