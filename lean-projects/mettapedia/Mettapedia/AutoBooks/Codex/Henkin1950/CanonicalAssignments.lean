Representative-substitution layer for Henkin pp. 86-87.

Henkin's p. 87 lemma evaluates an open formula under an assignment by choosing,
for each free variable, a closed representative term for the assigned domain
element and then replacing the free occurrences of that variable by that
representative. In the trusted HOL core, this is ordinary typed substitution
into the empty context. This file packages that operation and the induced
semantic/quotient interfaces in the paper-facing Codex namespace.
