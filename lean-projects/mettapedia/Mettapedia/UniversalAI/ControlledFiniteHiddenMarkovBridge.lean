# Controlled Finite HMM Bridge to BayesianAgents Environments

This file packages a controlled finite HMM as a history-conditional
environment in the `BayesianAgents.Core` sense.

We treat the environment state as latent, actions as externally supplied, and
percepts as emitted observations.

Positive example:
* a history ending in an action gets a next-percept distribution derived from
  the controlled latent belief state.

Negative example:
* this file does not yet include rewards, optimal control, or a credal
  observed-only WM layer.
