# MORK ↔ MQ-Calculus COMM Bridge

This file proves the structural correspondence between MORK's three-phase
execution and the MQ-calculus COMM rule.

## The Correspondence

MORK's binary fold (N=2 sub-queries) corresponds exactly to `CommReduction`:

```
MORK                              MQ-Calculus
----                              -----------
UnfoldStep (N=2 sub-queries)      MQOut i   (fires, spawns)
FoldStep sub-result-0 selected    CommReduction.outcome_zero (→ P)
FoldStep sub-result-1 selected    CommReduction.outcome_one  (→ Q)
Non-determinism: EITHER outcome   comm_both_outcomes i p q
```

The connection is:
- **MORK produces EITHER sub-result-0 OR sub-result-1** from the fold step,
  non-deterministically.  This is structural non-determinism: there exist
  TWO possible FoldStep firings (one per measurement outcome).
- **MQ-COMM produces EITHER P or Q** from `out i | in i {P, Q}`,
  non-deterministically.  Both `CommReduction.outcome_zero` and
  `CommReduction.outcome_one` are constructively inhabited.

## Key Definitions

`MorkOutcome`: which of the two sub-results a binary fold step "selects".
This is the abstract analog of `MeasurementBranch.outcome`.

## Spec Warning

This bridge formalizes the CURRENT (2026-02) MORK protocol.  The mapping
between `MorkOutcome` and `MeasurementBranch.outcome` is definitional: both
are binary enumerations indexed 0/1.  If MORK changes the fold protocol or
adds more sub-results, this bridge needs updating.

## Canary theorems

`canary_mork_binary_fold_is_nondeterministic` — both outcomes are constructively
inhabited for any binary fold step.  Fails if MORK makes folds deterministic.

`canary_comm_reduction_matches_mork_outcome` — for each MORK binary outcome,
there is a MQ `CommReduction` with the same branch selection.

/-! ## Core bridge theorem -/

/-- For each MORK binary fold outcome, there is a MQ `CommReduction` on
    corresponding processes with the matching branch.

    The mapping is:
    - `MorkOutcome.subResult0`  ↔  `CommReduction.outcome_zero` (selects P)
    - `MorkOutcome.subResult1`  ↔  `CommReduction.outcome_one`  (selects Q)

    This is proven constructively: we exhibit the `CommReduction` directly. -/

    outcomes.  This corresponds to `comm_both_outcomes` in MQCalculus. -/

generalizes from binary to arbitrary arity. -/
