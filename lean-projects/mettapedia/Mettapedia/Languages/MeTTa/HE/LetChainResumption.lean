# Let/Chain Resumption Refinement

Formalizes the missing middle layer between CeTTa's current eager
`OutcomeSet` collection for `let`/`chain` and a future resumable evaluator.

The key idea is a two-frame machine:
- a **source frame** enumerates source evaluation results
- a **body frame** enumerates the results of the body for one selected source
  result while remembering the suspended source continuation

This is the abstraction needed for heap-allocated resumption frames:
one call to `resume?` delivers exactly one body result, and the returned frame
contains all remaining work.

## Key results

- `run_source_eq_flatMap` — source-frame execution matches eager `flatMap`
- `resume?_decompose` — each resume step peels one result from the same list
- `resume?_none_iff_run_nil` — no resume step iff no residual results remain
- `resume?_toBag_step` — one resume step preserves bag semantics

## Connection to CeTTa

In `/home/zar/claude/c-projects/CeTTa-mork/src/eval.c`, both `let` and `chain`
currently evaluate the source expression eagerly into an `OutcomeSet`, then
iterate those results to evaluate bodies. This file proves that the same
observable behavior can be recovered by a resumable source/body frame split.
