# de Finetti's Theorem - L² Proof (Completed)

This file provides the **completed L² proof** of de Finetti's theorem by combining:
- `ViaL2`: Proves convergence A_n_m → α for each bounded f (Kallenberg Lemma 1.2)
- `CommonEnding`: Builds the kernel K from the map f ↦ α and completes the proof

This is **Kallenberg's "second proof"** (pages 26-27), which uses elementary L²
contractability bounds and is the lightest-weight approach with minimal dependencies.

## Proof architecture

The L² approach follows this structure:

1. **ViaL2.weighted_sums_converge_L1**: For contractable sequences X and bounded f,
   the weighted averages `A_n_m(f∘X) = (1/m) Σᵢ f(X_{n+i+1})` converge in L¹ to
   a limit α_f : Ω → ℝ

2. **Tail measurability**: Each α_f is tail-measurable, i.e., measurable with
   respect to the tail σ-algebra (follows from contractability)

3. **CommonEnding.conditional_iid_from_directing_measure**: Given the family
   {α_f}, construct a directing measure ν : Ω → Measure ℝ such that:
   - ν is a probability kernel
   - ν is tail-measurable
   - X is conditionally i.i.d. given ν

This yields the three-way equivalence (Kallenberg Theorem 1.1):
- (i) X is contractable
- (ii) X is exchangeable
- (iii) X is conditionally i.i.d.

These are the user-facing theorems that complete Kallenberg Theorem 1.1.
