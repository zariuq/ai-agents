- [ ] Equationally admissible sort assignments (Def 5.1)
- [ ] Generated modalities from rewrite rules
- [ ] Hypercube construction from sort slot assignments

## Implementation Principles (NO HACKS)

1. **Use Mathlib types** — don't reinvent Category, Functor, Frame, etc.
2. **Abstract over the term grammar** — use a typeclass/structure for GSLT terms, not hardcoded λ-terms
3. **Keep sorry count bounded** — each sorry must have a clear mathematical statement of what's needed
4. **Separate axioms from theorems** — if a result is axiomatized (assumed), mark it explicitly
5. **Build bottom-up** — each file should compile with all its imports
6. **Document paper references** — every definition cites the paper definition number

## Session 1 Plan: Core GSLT Definition

Start with `GSLT/Core/GSLT.lean` — the abstract GSLT triple (T, E, R).
This is the foundation everything else builds on.

Key design decision: How abstract should the term grammar be?
- Option A: Fully abstract (Type with operations) — most general but hard to prove things
- Option B: Parameterized by a signature — middle ground
- Option C: Inductive type with explicit constructors — concrete but less general

**Recommendation**: Option B — a GSLT is parameterized by a `Signature` that specifies
term constructors, and the grammar is the free term algebra over the signature.
This matches the paper's intent (GSLTs include λ-calculus, π-calculus, ρ-calculus, etc.)
while being concrete enough to prove structural results.
