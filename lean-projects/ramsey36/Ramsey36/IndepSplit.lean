# Split Independent Set Check for Fin 17

The full `decide` on `hasIndepSet 17 adj17Bool 6` causes kernel OOM.
Split into 12 sub-problems (one per first vertex), each fast for the kernel.

## LLM Notes
- adj17Bool and sub17_0..sub17_11 live in IndepSub17 (Mathlib-free).
- Combination uses hasIndepSetAux_false_of_compat from IndepSetChecker.
