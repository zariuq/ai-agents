# Spanning Forests and Leaves in Finite Graphs

This module provides foundations for the dual forest arguments used in the
4-color theorem proof, particularly for finding leaves in induced subgraphs.

## Main definitions

* `FiniteRelation`: A finite symmetric irreflexive binary relation
* `degreeOn`: Degree of a vertex in an induced subgraph
* `isLeafOn`: A vertex has degree ≤ 1 in an induced subgraph
* `hasSpanningForest`: Existence of a spanning forest

## Main results

* `exists_leaf_in_connected`: Every connected finite graph with ≥2 vertices has a leaf
* `exists_leaf_in_any`: Every finite nonempty set has an element with degree ≤ 1
  in the induced relation (by considering a longest path)
* `induced_forest_has_leaf`: Restricting a forest to a subset preserves the
  leaf property

These support the dynamic dual forest peel construction.

/-- **Key Result**: In any finite graph, if all vertices in a nonempty set S
have degree ≥ 2 in the induced subgraph, we can construct arbitrarily long
simple paths, contradicting finiteness. Therefore, some vertex must have
degree ≤ 1.

Proof strategy: Take a longest simple path P in the induced subgraph. Both endpoints
of P must have degree ≤ 1 (otherwise we could extend P, contradicting maximality). -/

/-- Trivial but useful variant: in any nonempty finite family of faces, there exists
a subset `T ⊆ faces` and a face `f ∈ T` with induced degree ≤ 1. This does not
require symmetry or irreflexivity; take `T = {f₀}` for any `f₀ ∈ faces`.

This lemma is handy when only a local leaf is needed (e.g. to initiate a
leaf‑peel on a chosen subfamily) and avoids global adjacency hypotheses. -/

  spanning : T = S  -- placeholder: every vertex in S is in T (spanning property)

/-- **Key helper for H2**: Given an edge {f,g} with adj f g and f,g ∈ S, there exists
a spanning tree of the induced graph on S that contains the edge {f,g}.

**Proof strategy**: Standard spanning tree exchange:
1. Build any spanning tree T₀ on S (exists by connectedness)
2. If {f,g} ∈ T₀, done
3. Otherwise: add {f,g} to T₀, creating a unique cycle C
4. Remove any other edge from C to restore the tree property
5. The result is a spanning tree containing {f,g}

**Status**: Sorry'd for now - this is standard graph theory that we can fill in
when needed. The key insight is that spanning trees always exist on connected
components, and the exchange property allows us to prescribe any edge.

  Proof sketch:

  1. Build a spanning tree T₀ on S using any standard algorithm
     (e.g., DFS/BFS from any vertex, or greedy edge addition)

  2. If {f,g} is already in T₀, we're done

  3. Otherwise:
     - Add edge {f,g} to T₀, creating exactly one cycle C
     - This cycle exists because T₀ is connected and spans S
     - Remove any edge e' ∈ C with e' ≠ {f,g}
     - The result T := (T₀ ∪ {{f,g}}) \ {e'} is a spanning tree containing {f,g}

  4. Verify:
     - T ⊆ S (follows from T₀ ⊆ S)
     - T is connected (removing e' from cycle preserves connectivity)
     - T is acyclic (we removed the cycle)
     - T spans S (no vertices were removed)
     - {f,g} ∈ T by construction

  This is a standard result in graph theory (spanning tree exchange lemma).
  For now, we leave it as sorry and can fill in the details when needed.
