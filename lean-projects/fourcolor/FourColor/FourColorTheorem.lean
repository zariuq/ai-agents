/-- **The Four Color Theorem**: Every planar graph admits a proper 4-vertex-coloring.

This is stated for graphs given by an adjacency relation `adj : V → V → Prop`.
In the planar case, such graphs can be embedded in the plane, giving rise to
a rotation system which provides the combinatorial structure needed for the proof.

The proof strategy (Kauffman/Spencer-Brown via Tait):
1. Reduce to 3-edge-colorability of cubic dual graphs (Tait's equivalence)
2. Use Lemma 4.5 to show zero-boundary chains span face boundaries
3. Apply Strong Dual to get orthogonality structure
4. Use Kempe chain reachability to construct proper 3-edge-coloring
5. Convert back to 4-vertex-coloring via Tait reverse direction

**Status**: Partially proven. Core geometry (Disk, Lemma 4.5, Strong Dual) complete.
Remaining: Kempe chains, Tait equivalence, integration.

theorem four_color_theorem :
    ∀ (V E : Type*) [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] [Fintype E] [DecidableEq E]
      (adj : V → V → Prop),
      -- Planar embedding assumption (via rotation system)
      (∃ (RS : Geometry.RotationSystem V E), True) →
      -- Conclusion: 4-vertex-colorable
      ∃ (coloring : @FourVertexColoring V E _ _ adj), True := by
  intro V E _ _ _ _ adj hplanar

  -- Step 1: Extract the rotation system from the planar embedding
  obtain ⟨RS, _⟩ := hplanar

  -- Step 2: Construct the dual graph (faces become vertices, edges stay edges)
  -- The dual of a planar graph is cubic (each face has bounded degree)
  have dual_is_cubic : ∃ (incident : Finset E → Finset E), IsCubic incident := by
    -- For a triangulation, each internal face has exactly 3 edges
    -- Need: Construction of dual graph from rotation system
    sorry
  obtain ⟨dual_incident, h_cubic⟩ := dual_is_cubic

  -- Step 3: Define dual adjacency and show it's bridgeless
  let dual_adj : (Finset E) → (Finset E) → Prop := fun _ _ => True  -- Placeholder
  have dual_is_bridgeless : IsBridgeless dual_adj := by
    -- Bridges in the dual correspond to cut vertices in the primal
    -- Planar graphs are 2-connected after removing degree-1 vertices
    -- For now, IsBridgeless is trivially True
    trivial

  -- Step 4: By Tait's equivalence, it suffices to show the dual is 3-edge-colorable
  -- We use the reverse direction: 3-edge-colorable dual → 4-vertex-colorable primal

  -- We'll construct a 3-edge-coloring of the dual, then apply Tait reverse
  -- Step 5: Construct 3-edge-coloring using Kauffman/Lemma 4.5 approach
  -- This is where the deep mathematics happens!

  -- Step 5a: Use Lemma 4.5 to show zero-boundary chains span face boundaries
  have lemma_4_5 : ∃ (spanning : Unit), True := by
    -- Lemma 4.5: Zero-boundary chains generate all face boundaries
    -- This is proven in Triangulation.lean via the Strong Dual
    sorry

  -- Step 5b: Apply Strong Dual to get orthogonality structure
  have strong_dual : ∃ (orthogonal_structure : Unit), True := by
    -- Strong Dual provides orthogonality between chains and boundaries
    -- This gives us the algebraic structure needed for coloring
    sorry

  -- Step 5c: Use Kempe chain reachability to construct proper 3-edge-coloring
  have kempe_reachability : ∃ (ec : @ThreeEdgeColoring (Finset E) E _ _ dual_incident), True := by
    -- Key insight: Kempe chains connect colorings
    -- If we can't 3-edge-color, we can construct a contradiction
    -- via Kempe chain switches and the zero-boundary structure

    -- Need: KempeExistence lemmas to show we can always find valid colorings
    sorry

  -- Step 6: Apply Tait reverse to get 4-vertex-coloring
  obtain ⟨edge_coloring, _⟩ := kempe_reachability

  -- Apply Tait reverse: converts 3-edge-coloring of dual → 4-vertex-coloring of primal
  -- Note: tait_reverse gives us a coloring on dual vertices (Finset E)
  -- We need to convert this to a coloring on primal vertices (V)
  -- This is the geometric dual correspondence
  have primal_coloring : ∃ (coloring : @FourVertexColoring V E _ _ adj), True := by
    -- Need: Dual construction that maps Finset E → V
    -- The 3-edge-coloring of the dual becomes a 4-vertex-coloring of the primal
