/-- A vertex v is "swappable" for colors c₁, c₂ if:
    - Some neighbor of v has color c₁
    - We can swap c₁↔c₂ on the Kempe chain containing a c₁-neighbor

    let K := VertexKempeChain adj coloring c₁ c₂ w
    let coloring' := kempeSwitch coloring K c₁ c₂
    (∃ c' : VertexColor, ∀ u, adj v u → coloring' u ≠ c'))

/-- If we can swap colors c₁↔c₂ at a vertex v, then v becomes colorable. -/

    then removing any vertex yields a 4-colorable graph. (Converse is also true.)

  -- Now show ∃ c free after swap
  -- GOERTZEL'S ALGEBRAIC APPROACH (Disk Kempe-Closure Spanning Lemma)
  --
  -- Key insight from Goertzel's proof (Theorem 4.10):
  -- Kempe switches generate the vector space W₀(H) of boundary-compatible colorings.
  -- This means: given boundary constraints (the neighbors of v), we can reach
  -- ANY coloring compatible with those constraints through Kempe operations.
  --
  -- In our setting:
  -- - We have 4 colors at neighbors (boundary condition)
  -- - We want to reach a state where SOME color is free at v
  -- - By the spanning lemma, such a state exists in the Kempe-closure
  --
  -- The proof proceeds by checking if the chosen pair (α,β) works:
  -- - If w₂ ∉ K: The swap frees α (successful case)
  -- - If w₂ ∈ K: Try a different pair
  --
  -- The spanning lemma guarantees that among the 6 possible color pairs,
  -- at least one will free a color (because the Kempe-closure spans all
  -- boundary-compatible colorings, including those with a free color).
  --
  -- This is fundamentally an algebraic/linear algebra argument over F₂×F₂,
  -- not a planarity/degree argument.

  -- Check if w₂ is in K (the Kempe chain containing w₁)
  by_cases hw₂_in_K : w₂ ∈ K
  · -- Case: w₂ ∈ K (both α-neighbor and β-neighbor in same component)
    -- Swapping this pair may not free α (both neighbors would swap)
    --
    -- GOERTZEL'S SPANNING ARGUMENT:
    -- By Theorem 4.10 (Disk Kempe-Closure Spanning Lemma), the Kempe-closure
    -- spans all boundary-compatible colorings. Since a coloring with ≤3 colors
    -- at neighbors exists (freeing at least one color), we can reach it via
    -- Kempe switches.
    --
    -- Concretely: Try the remaining 5 color pairs. By the spanning property,
    -- at least one pair will have disconnected components and free a color.
    --
    -- For now, we assert existence (full proof requires iterating pairs):
    sorry  -- TODO: Implement pair iteration OR
          --       Formalize Disk Kempe-Closure Spanning Lemma (Goertzel Thm 4.10)
          --       to directly derive existence of freed color

  · -- Case: w₂ ∉ K (α-neighbor and β-neighbor in different components)
    -- When w₂ ∉ K, we have α-neighbor w₁ ∈ K and β-neighbor w₂ ∉ K
    -- This suggests α will be freed, but verification requires checking
    -- the canonical iff conditions (i) and (ii).

    -- GOERTZEL'S APPROACH: The spanning lemma guarantees that SOME pair
    -- satisfies these conditions. The challenge is proving that THIS pair works,
    -- or iterating to find the right pair.

    -- For now, we'll assert that this case works (similar to the w₂ ∈ K case).
    -- Full proof requires either:
    --   (A) Proving conditions (i) and (ii) directly (needs graph structure)
    --   (B) Iterating through all 6 pairs and showing at least one works
    --   (C) Invoking the full spanning lemma (Goertzel Theorem 4.10)

    use α
    intro u hadj_u

    -- To show: coloring' u ≠ α
    -- This follows from the canonical iff theorem IF conditions (i) and (ii) hold.
    -- Those conditions are:
    --   (i) All α-neighbors of v are in K
    --   (ii) No β-neighbor of v is in K

    -- We know: w₁ has α and w₁ ∈ K; w₂ has β and w₂ ∉ K
    -- But proving (i) and (ii) in general requires additional structure.

    sorry  -- TODO: Three options:
          --   1. Prove conditions (i) and (ii) using graph connectivity
          --   2. Iterate through all 6 color pairs (guaranteed by spanning lemma)
          --   3. Formalize Disk Kempe-Closure Spanning Lemma (Goertzel Thm 4.10)
          --
          -- Note: Cases w₂ ∈ K and w₂ ∉ K both need the spanning argument.
          -- The real work is showing at least ONE of the 6 pairs works.

/-- Main inductive lemma: Given a 4-coloring of V-{v}, either extend directly
    or use a Kempe swap to free a color. Returns possibly modified coloring + color for v.

    Key insight from W₆ counterexample: when deg(v)=5 and neighbors use all 4 colors,
    we MUST modify the coloring via Kempe swap - direct extension is impossible.

    IMPORTANT: freeing color α at v by swapping on an αβ-component requires:
      (i) all α-neighbors of v are in that component, and
      (ii) no β-neighbor of v is in that component.
    See `FourColor.Kempe.Guardrails.frees_α_at_v_iff` for the canonical theorem.
