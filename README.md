# AI-Assisted Formal Mathematics Projects

Formal verification projects developed with AI assistance (Claude, Gemini, etc.).

## Projects

### Four Color Theorem (4CP)

Novel proof approach via Kempe chain algebra and XOR parity.

- **[lean-projects/fourcolor/](lean-projects/fourcolor/)** - Lean 4 formalization
- **[isabelle/4CP/](isabelle/4CP/)** - Isabelle/HOL formalization
- **[mizar-projects/4cp/](mizar-projects/4cp/)** - Mizar formalization

### Ramsey Theory

- **[lean-projects/ramsey36/](lean-projects/ramsey36/)** - R(3,6) = 18 formalization in Lean 4
- **[megalodon/ramsey36/](megalodon/ramsey36/)** - Adj17 edge theorem proofs

### Tools

- **[tools/tptp-metta/](tools/tptp-metta/)** - TPTP ↔ S-expression ↔ MeTTa converters, propositional resolution prover

## Status

Work in progress. See individual project READMEs for details.
