(* BRIDGE THEORY: Connect our formulation to scratch file proofs            *)
(* ========================================================================= *)
(*
  This theory bridges our Disk_RunPurification formulation with the complete
  proofs in codex_scratch/Face_Purification_Lift.thy.

  Key differences:
  - Our xor_fold :: ('a => 'e chain) => 'a set => 'e chain
  - Their xor_fold_set :: ('e chain) set => 'e chain

  Strategy: Prove equivalence, then import their proven theorems.
*)

(* Step 1: Prove our xor_fold equivalent to their xor_fold_set on images *)
lemma xor_fold_equiv:
  assumes "finite A"
  shows "xor_fold f A = xor_fold_set (f ` A)"
  (* Both definitions use Finite_Set.fold with same combining function.
     For finite A, fold f A = fold id (f ` A) by fold/image correspondence. *)
  sorry

(* Step 2: Re-state their theorem in our terms *)
lemma xor_over_runs_yields_B_face_imported:
  assumes proper: "proper3 C"
  assumes finite_boundary: "finite (boundary_of f)"
  shows "xor_fold (%R. X_face a b f C) (maximal_runs a b f C) = B_face a b f"
  (* Use their proven xor_over_runs_yields_B_face_ab plus our equivalence *)
  sorry
