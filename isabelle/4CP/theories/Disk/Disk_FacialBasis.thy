(* M4b: FACIAL BASIS THEOREM FOR ZERO-BOUNDARY CHAINS                       *)
(* ========================================================================= *)
(*
  THEOREM (Facial Basis):
  Every zero-boundary chain in a planar disk graph can be expressed as
  a linear combination (XOR sum) of face boundary chains.

  PROOF STRATEGY:
  1. Each face boundary has zero boundary at interior vertices
  2. At boundary vertices, face boundaries XOR to zero around the disk
  3. Use Euler's formula for planar graphs: V - E + F = 2 (for disk: 1)
  4. Dimension count: dim(W0) = E - V + 1 = F - 1 (# interior faces)
  5. Face boundaries are independent and span W0

  - Cycle space theory (Diestel "Graph Theory", Chapter 1.9)
  - For formal verification: Induction on dual spanning forest

(* Step 1: Face boundaries have zero boundary                               *)
(* ========================================================================= *)

(* CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT:
   A face boundary is a closed cycle, so at each vertex v:
   - Exactly 2 edges of the face are incident to v (since it's a cycle)
   - These two edges contribute opposite parities
   - Sum is 0 (mod 2) at each coordinate

   This is a topological fact about planar embeddings.

proof -
  (* For each vertex v and each coordinate:
     The face boundary edges incident to v form a path segment,
     contributing even parity (0 or 2 edges) at each coordinate. *)

(* Step 2: Face boundaries span W0 (dimension argument)                     *)
(* ========================================================================= *)

(* CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT (Dimension Counting):

   For a connected planar disk graph with:
   - V vertices
   - E edges
   - F faces (including outer face)
   - Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2 for sphere, = 1 for disk

   Chain space dimensions:
   - Total chain space: dim = 2E (two coordinates per edge, over GF(2))
   - Boundary map: chains → vertex parities, kernel = zero-boundary
   - Boundary is surjective onto (GF(2))^V (at interior vertices)
   - dim(W0) = 2E - (V-1) = 2E - V + 1

   Face boundary space:
   - Each face contributes 1 independent boundary chain (per coordinate)
   - Inner faces: F - 1 (excluding outer face)
   - dim(face boundaries) = 2(F-1) = 2F - 2

   By Euler: V - E + F = 1
   ⟹ 2F - 2 = 2(E - V + 1) = dim(W0)

   Since face boundaries ⊆ W0 and have the same dimension,
   they span W0.

(* ========================================================================= *)
(* M4b: MAIN THEOREM - Facial Basis for W0 (Theorem 4.8)                   *)
(* ========================================================================= *)

(* Every zero-boundary chain is in span of face boundaries *)
theorem facial_basis_W0:
  shows "zero_boundary <= cspan {B_face a b f | a b f. True}"
  (* PROOF BY MEASURE INDUCTION on card(support y)

     The key idea: every zero-boundary chain can be "peeled" by XORing with
     face boundaries until its support becomes empty, at which point it's zero.

     STRUCTURE:
     1. Measure: m(y) = card(support y)
     2. Base case (m = 0): support y = {} ⟹ y = zero_chain ∈ cspan
        - Use masking lemma: chain with empty support equals zero_chain
        - zero_chain ∈ cspan by cspan_zero
     3. Inductive step (m > 0):
        a. Find a leaf face f using exists_leaf_face
        b. XOR y with B_face f to get y' = y ⊕ B_face f
        c. By support_shrink_after_xor: support y' ⊂ support y (strict)
        d. By B_face_preserves_zero_boundary: y' ∈ zero_boundary
        e. By IH: y' ∈ cspan (since card(support y') < card(support y))
        f. Since y = y' ⊕ B_face f and both in cspan, so is y (by cspan_xor)
