# Mizar 4-Color Theorem Project - Git Ignore
# This file helps git and Claude Code ignore build artifacts while keeping source files tracked

# === Build Directory ===
# Entire build/ directory contains only generated files - ignore completely
build/

# === Mizar Build Artifacts ===
# These files are generated by the Mizar compiler in text/ directories
# Source files (.miz, .voc, .md) will still be tracked

# Compiler output and intermediate files

# === Source Files (DO NOT IGNORE) ===
# These patterns ensure source files are tracked:
# - *.miz (Mizar source articles)
# - *.voc (Mizar vocabulary files) - in dict/ directories
# - *.md (Documentation)
# No need to explicitly negate them - they're not matched by the patterns above
