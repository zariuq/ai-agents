:: Example 1: Simple coherence (automatic)
definition
  func empty_set -> set equals
  :Def1:
  {};
  coherence;
end;

:: Example 2: Missing coherence - what happens?
:: Uncomment to see Error 73
:: definition
::   func bad_func -> set equals
::   :Def2:
::   {};
:: end;

:: Example 3: Coherence with explanation comment
definition
  let X be set;
  func single X -> set equals
  :Def3:
  X;
  coherence;  :: Proves that X is indeed a set (type correctness)
end;
