:: PARTITION AND SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE (Constructive Approach)
::=============================================================================

:: **Key Insight:**
:: When runs partition a boundary (disjoint sets covering everything),
:: their iterated symmetric difference equals the whole boundary!
::
:: Mathematical reasoning:
:: - For disjoint sets: (A △ B) = A ∪ B
:: - Iterating: SymDiff({R1, R2, ..., Rn}) = R1 ∪ R2 ∪ ... ∪ Rn
:: - When runs partition boundary: union(runs) = boundary
:: - Therefore: SymDiff(runs) = boundary
