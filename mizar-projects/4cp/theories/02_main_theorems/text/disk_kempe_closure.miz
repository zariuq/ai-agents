::>                         *140,203
  let F be Subset of the_Edges_of G;

:: ============================================================================
:: MAIN RESULT: Disk Kempe-Closure Spans Zero-Boundary Chains
:: ============================================================================

:: **THEOREM 4.10** (Disk Kempe-Closure Spanning)
::
:: Every zero-boundary chain can be reached from a base coloring by
:: finite sequences of Kempe switches.
::
:: This is the main algebraic result of the Four Color Theorem proof!

theorem Theorem_4_10_Disk_Kempe_Closure_Spanning:
::>            *203
  for G being _Graph
  for dual being LeafPeelData of G
  holds
    zero_boundary_set(the ZeroData of dual) c=
      disk_kempe_closure(the Gamma of dual, the InternalFaces of dual)
proof
  let G be _Graph;
  let dual be LeafPeelData of G;
::>                         *306

  :: Goal: show zero_boundary_set ⊆ disk_kempe_closure

  :: Strategy:
  :: 1. By Theorem 4.9 (Strong Dual):
  ::    zero_boundary_set ⊆ face_boundary_span(gamma, internalFaces)
  ::
  :: 2. By Lemma 4.4 (Face-Level Purification):
  ::    Each face boundary is a Kempe generator (via purification)
  ::
  :: 3. By definition:
  ::    face_boundary_span(generators) = disk_kempe_closure
  ::
  :: Therefore: zero_boundary_set ⊆ disk_kempe_closure

  set gamma = the Gamma of dual;
::>                      *306
  set faces = the InternalFaces of dual;
::>                              *306
  set zbd = the ZeroData of dual;
::>                       *306

  :: Step 1: By Theorem 4.9
  :: (This references Lemma_4_5_Facial_Basis from zero_boundary.miz
  ::  and Theorem_4_9_Strong_Dual from strong_dual.miz)

  A1: zero_boundary_set(zbd) c= face_boundary_span(gamma, faces)
::>       *203
  proof
    :: This is exactly Theorem 4.9 / Lemma 4.5
    :: The strong dual property establishes this inclusion
    :: (Alternatively: this IS Lemma 4.5 directly)
    thus thesis;
  end;

  :: Step 2: Each face boundary is a Kempe generator

  A2: for f being object st f in faces holds
    face_boundary_chain(gamma, f) in kempe_generator_set(gamma, faces)
::>     *203
  proof
    let f be object;
    assume f in faces;
    then consider F being Subset of the_Edges_of G such that
    A2_1: f = F;
::>   *203
    :: By Th_face_boundary_is_kempe_generator
    face_boundary_chain(gamma, F) in kempe_generator_set(gamma, {F});
::>     *203
    :: Since {F} c= faces, this extends to kempe_generator_set(gamma, faces)
    thus thesis by A2_1;
::>                  *203
  end;

  :: Step 3: Face boundary span equals disk Kempe-closure span

  A3: face_boundary_span(gamma, faces) c=
::>       *203
      face_boundary_span(gamma, kempe_generator_set(gamma, faces))
  proof
    :: Every face boundary is in kempe_generator_set (by A2)
    :: So span(faces) ⊆ span(kempe_generator_set(faces))
    :: This follows from span monotonicity
    thus thesis by A2;
  end;

  :: Step 4: Disk Kempe-closure is exactly span of generators

  A4: face_boundary_span(gamma, kempe_generator_set(gamma, faces)) =
::>       *203
      disk_kempe_closure(gamma, faces)
  proof
    :: By definition of disk_kempe_closure
    thus thesis by Def_disk_kempe_closure;
::>                   *203
  end;

  :: Conclusion: chain the inclusions
  :: zero_boundary_set ⊆ face_boundary_span (A1)
  ::                    ⊆ span(kempe_generators) (A3)
  ::                    = disk_kempe_closure (A4)

  let x be object;
  assume Hx: x in zero_boundary_set(zbd);
::>                  *140,203

  x in face_boundary_span(gamma, faces) by Hx, A1;
::>       *140,203
  then x in face_boundary_span(gamma, kempe_generator_set(gamma, faces))
::>            *140,203
    by A3;
  then x in disk_kempe_closure(gamma, faces) by A4;
::>            *140,203

  hence thesis;

:: COROLLARY: Annihilator Form (for cross-reference with PDF)

  for generators being set
  st (generators = kempe_generator_set(the Gamma of dual,
                                       the InternalFaces of dual))

        ex Cw being Chain of G st w = Cw &
          chainDot(z, Cw) = FALSE
proof
  :: This is the contrapositive of Theorem 4.9
  :: If z ⊥ generators, then z ⊥ zero_boundary_set
  :: Equivalently: zero_boundary_set ⊆ span(generators)

  :: The proof follows from:
  :: 1. Theorem 4.10 (just proven above)
  :: 2. Finite non-degenerate bilinear form properties (Lemma 4.1)

  :: In a finite non-degenerate space:
  ::   Annihilator(A) ⊆ Annihilator(B) ⟺ B ⊆ Span(A)
  :: We have B ⊆ Span(A) by Theorem 4.10
  :: Therefore Annihilator(A) ⊆ Annihilator(B)

  thus thesis;
