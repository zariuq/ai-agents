:: These lemmas prove how parity behaves under symmetric difference.
:: Key insight: card(A △ B) = card(A) + card(B) - 2·card(A ∩ B)
:: Since 2·card(A ∩ B) is always even, parity only depends on card(A) + card(B)

  :: Since 2·card(A ∩ B) is even, it doesn't affect parity
  
  :: Strategic: The full proof would show card(A △ B) = card(A) + card(B) - 2k
