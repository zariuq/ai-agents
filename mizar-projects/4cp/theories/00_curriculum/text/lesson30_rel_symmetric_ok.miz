theorem
  for X being set
  for R being Relation of X st R is symmetric
  for x,y being Element of X holds
    [x,y] in R implies [y,x] in R
proof
  let X be set;
  let R be Relation of X;
  assume A0: R is symmetric;
  let x,y be Element of X;
  assume [x,y] in R;
  then [y,x] in R by A0, RELAT_2:def 11;
  hence thesis;
end;
