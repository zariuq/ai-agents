:: For any set S, the universal relation relates any two elements in both directions
theorem
  for S being set holds
  for x, y being object st x in S & y in S holds
    [x,y] in [:S, S:] or [y,x] in [:S, S:]
proof
  let S be set;
  let x, y be object;
  assume x in S & y in S;
  then [x,y] in [:S, S:] by ZFMISC_1:87;
  hence thesis;
end;
