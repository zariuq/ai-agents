:: Lesson 21A (NEGATIVE): Infix Operator with Declared Properties â€” bad local vocabulary
:: This article intentionally uses a local vocabulary name (LESSON21)
:: without providing dict/LESSON21.voc. If you compile from inside
:: text/ (cd text && mizf lesson21_op_props), you will hit Error 801
:: (cannot find vocabulary file). Compile from module root to avoid 801,
:: but it will still fail due to missing vocabulary.

definition
  let A,B be set;
  func A (+) B -> set equals
  :DefPlus:
  A \/ B;
  coherence;
  commutativity;
  associativity;
  idempotence;
end;

theorem
  for A,B being set holds A (+) B = B (+) A
proof let A,B be set; thus thesis; end;

theorem
  for A,B,C being set holds (A (+) B) (+) C = A (+) (B (+) C)
proof let A,B,C be set; thus thesis; end;

theorem
  for A being set holds A (+) A = A
proof let A be set; thus thesis; end;
