theorem
  for X being set, F being Function of [:X,X:], BOOLEAN st
  (for a,b being object st a in X & b in X holds F.[a,b] = F.[b,a]) holds
  ex R being Relation of X st
    (for a,b being object st a in X & b in X holds
      [a,b] in R iff F.[a,b] = TRUE) &
    R is symmetric
proof
  let X be set, F be Function of [:X,X:], BOOLEAN;
  assume A0: for a,b being object st a in X & b in X holds F.[a,b] = F.[b,a];
  set S = { [a,b] where a,b is object : a in X & b in X & F.[a,b] = TRUE };
  A1: S c= [:X,X:]
  proof
    let z be object; assume z in S;
    then ex a,b being object st a in X & b in X & z = [a,b] & F.[a,b] = TRUE;
    hence z in [:X,X:] by ZFMISC_1:87;
  end;
  reconsider R = S as Relation of X by A1, RELSET_1:1;
  take R;
  thus for a,b being object st a in X & b in X holds
    [a,b] in R iff F.[a,b] = TRUE;
  thus R is symmetric
  proof
    let x,y be object;
    assume x in X & y in X & [x,y] in R;
    then ex a,b being object st a in X & b in X & [x,y] = [a,b] & F.[a,b] = TRUE;
    then F.[y,x] = F.[x,y] & F.[x,y] = TRUE by A0;
    then F.[y,x] = TRUE;
    hence [y,x] in R;
  end;
end;
