theorem
  for A, U being set holds (A /\ U) /\ U = A /\ U
proof
  let A, U be set;
  for x being object holds (x in (A /\ U) /\ U iff x in A /\ U)
  proof
    let x be object;
    hereby
      assume x in (A /\ U) /\ U;
      then x in A /\ U & x in U by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
      then x in A & x in U by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
      hence x in A /\ U by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    end;
    assume x in A /\ U;
    then x in A & x in U by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    then x in A /\ U & x in U by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    hence x in (A /\ U) /\ U by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
  end;
  hence thesis by TARSKI:2;
