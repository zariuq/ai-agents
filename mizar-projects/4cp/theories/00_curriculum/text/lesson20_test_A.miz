:: Lesson 20 TEST (NEGATIVE): Prove set equality without double inclusion
:: Demonstrates Error 4 - inference not accepted (incomplete proof)
:: Expected error: 4 (equality needs both directions or TARSKI:2)

  coherence;
end;

theorem ThBadEquality:
  for X, Y being set st X c= Y & Y c= X holds X = Y
proof
  let X, Y be set;
  assume X c= Y & Y c= X;
  :: Missing proof steps - need TARSKI:2 or explicit reasoning
  thus thesis;
