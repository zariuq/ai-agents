definition
  let X be non empty set;
  let F be Function of [:X,X:], BOOLEAN;
  attr F is symmetric means
  for a,b being Element of X holds F.(a,b) = F.(b,a);
end;

theorem
  for X being non empty set,
      F being Function of [:X,X:], BOOLEAN st F is symmetric holds
  for a being Element of X holds F.(a,a) = F.(a,a)
proof
  let X be non empty set, F be Function of [:X,X:], BOOLEAN;
  assume F is symmetric;
  let a be Element of X;
  thus thesis;
end;
