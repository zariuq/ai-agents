::Lesson 10: Complex Proof Patterns - REALISTIC EXAMPLES
::
:: Goal: Master advanced proof tactics with meaningful theorems
:: Patterns: hereby, per cases, given - applied to real problems
::
:: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR 4CP:
:: - Graph colorability requires case analysis (per cases)
:: - Existential witnesses need extraction (given, consider)
:: - Bidirectional equivalences are common (hereby for iff)

:: ====================
:: PATTERN 1: hereby (Bidirectional Proofs)
:: ====================
:: Real theorem: Set union commutativity characterization

theorem Th1:
  for X, Y being set holds X \/ Y = Y \/ X
proof
  let X, Y be set;
  thus X \/ Y c= Y \/ X
  proof
    let x be object;
    assume x in X \/ Y;
    hence x in Y \/ X;
  end;
  thus Y \/ X c= X \/ Y
  proof
    let x be object;
    assume x in Y \/ X;
    hence x in X \/ Y;
  end;
end;

:: ====================
:: PATTERN 2: per cases (Real Case Analysis)
:: ====================
:: Real theorem: Union with subset

theorem Th2:
  for X, Y being set st Y c= X holds X \/ Y = X
proof
  let X, Y be set;
  assume
A1: Y c= X;
  thus X \/ Y c= X
  proof
    let x be object;
    assume x in X \/ Y;
    per cases;
    suppose x in X;
      hence x in X;
    end;
    suppose x in Y;
      hence x in X by A1;
    end;
  end;
  thus X c= X \/ Y
  proof
    let x be object;
    assume x in X;
    hence x in X \/ Y;
  end;
end;

:: ====================
:: PATTERN 3: given (Existential Extraction)
:: ====================
:: Real theorem: Non-empty has element

theorem Th3:
  for X being set st (ex x being object st x in X) holds X <> {}
proof
  let X be set;
  given x being object such that
A1: x in X;
  assume X = {};
  then not x in X;
  hence contradiction by A1;
end;

:: ====================
:: PATTERN 4: hereby with per cases (Combined)
:: ====================
:: Real theorem: Intersection characterization

theorem Th4:
  for X, Y being set holds
    X /\ Y = {} iff (for x being object holds not (x in X & x in Y))
proof
  let X, Y be set;
  hereby
    assume X /\ Y = {};
    let x be object;
    assume x in X & x in Y;
    then x in X /\ Y;
    hence contradiction;
  end;
  assume
A1: for x being object holds not (x in X & x in Y);
  assume X /\ Y <> {};
  then consider x being object such that
A2: x in X /\ Y;
  x in X & x in Y by A2;
  hence contradiction by A1;
end;

:: ====================
:: PATTERN 5: Complex Case Analysis
:: ====================
:: Real theorem: Set trichotomy

theorem Th5:
  for X being set holds X = {} or ex x being object st x in X
proof
  let X be set;
  per cases;
  suppose X = {};
    hence thesis;
  end;
  suppose X <> {};
    then ex x being object st x in X;
    hence thesis;
  end;
end;

:: ====================
:: KEY LESSONS FOR 4CP
:: ====================
::
:: 1. hereby FOR BIDIRECTIONAL PROOFS
::    - Common pattern: "A iff B"
::    - First direction: hereby ... end;
::    - Second direction: assume B; prove A
::    - Example: Graph planarity equivalences
::
:: 2. per cases FOR CASE ANALYSIS
::    - Exhaustive case splitting
::    - Each case: suppose ... hence thesis; end;
::    - Example: Colorability depends on structure
::    - Example: Edge cases (empty, single vertex, etc.)
::
:: 3. given FOR WITNESS EXTRACTION
::    - Extracts from "ex x st P[x]" assumptions
::    - Syntax: given x being TYPE such that LABEL: PROP;
::    - Example: Extract vertex from non-empty graph
::    - Example: Extract edge witnesses in planarity proofs
::
:: 4. COMBINED PATTERNS
::    - hereby with per cases inside
::    - per cases with given in each branch
::    - Complex reasoning mirrors mathematical practice
::
:: ====================
:: COMPARISON TO TRIVIAL VERSION
:: ====================
::
:: Old Lesson 10 (trivial):
::   theorem: X = X proof thus thesis; end;
::
:: New Lesson 10 (realistic):
::   - Union commutativity (Th1)
::   - Subset union (Th2)
::   - Non-empty characterization (Th3)
::   - Intersection emptiness (Th4)
::   - Set trichotomy (Th5)
::
:: These are REAL theorems you'd prove in graph theory!
::
:: ====================
:: 4CP APPLICATION EXAMPLES
:: ====================
::
:: Graph Colorability (per cases):
::   per cases;
::   suppose G is_3_colorable;
::     hence G is planar_4_colorable;
::   end;
::   suppose G is not 3_colorable;
::     :: prove using reduction
::   end;
::
:: Planarity Witness (given):
::   given embedding being PlanarEmbedding of G such that
::   A1: embedding is valid;
::   :: prove properties using A1
::
:: Equivalence (hereby):
::   theorem: G is planar iff ex embedding st embedding is valid
::   proof
::     hereby
::       assume G is planar;
::       :: construct embedding witness
::     end;
::     assume ex embedding st embedding is valid;
::     :: prove planarity
::   end;
