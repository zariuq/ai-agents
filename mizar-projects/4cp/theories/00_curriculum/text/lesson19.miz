:: Lesson 19: The Dot Notation - Function Application Made Fun!
::
:: Goal: Master the . (dot) operator for function application
:: Fun Example: Mood Maps on Graphs (vertices → happy/sad moods)
::
:: Key Discovery: From MML survey (bcialg_6, conlat_1, field_12, fomodel3, etc.)
:: The dot is Mizar's function application: f.x means "value of f at x"
::
:: Why Error 103 happens: Mizar must SEE that f is function-like at that point!
:: Solution: Use typed quantification in means clauses

:: ============================================================================
:: Pattern 4: Graph-specific example (realistic!)
:: ============================================================================

:: Now use actual Graph infrastructure from GRAPH_1

reserve G for Graph;
reserve v for Vertex of G;

:: A VertexMood is a function from vertices to moods

definition
  let G be Graph;
  mode VertexMood of G is Function of the carrier of G, BOOLEAN;
end;

:: Check if all vertices are happy

  for v being Vertex of G holds m.v = TRUE;
  ::                              ^^^

end;

:: Create the "always happy" mood

definition
  let G be Graph;
  func AlwaysHappy(G) -> VertexMood of G equals
  [:the carrier of G, {TRUE}:];

  let G be Graph;
  let v be Vertex of G;
  AlwaysHappy(G).v = TRUE by FUNCT_2:7;

:: ============================================================================
:: Pattern 5: Combining moods on two graphs
:: ============================================================================

:: If two graphs have same vertex set, we can compare their moods!

definition
  let X be non empty set;
  let m1, m2 be Function of X, BOOLEAN;
  pred m1 agrees_with m2 means
  :DefAgrees:

  for m being Function of X, BOOLEAN
  st X is non empty
  holds not m agrees_with FlipMood(m)
proof
  let X be non empty set;
  let m be Function of X, BOOLEAN;
  assume X is non empty;
  then consider x being object such that
  A1: x in X by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
  reconsider x as Element of X by A1;

:: ============================================================================
:: Key Lessons: When does the dot work?
:: ============================================================================

:: ✅ DOT WORKS WHEN:
::    - Left side: f has visible type "Function of A, B"
::    - Right side: x has visible type "Element of A" (or x in A)
::    - Context: Mizar can SEE both types at that point!
::
:: ✅ IN MEANS CLAUSES:
::    Use "for x being Element of X holds it.x = ..."
::    The typed quantification makes types visible!
::
:: ✅ IN THEOREMS:
::    Declare types in let/for: "let f be Function of X, Y"
::    Then f.x works everywhere in the proof!
::
:: ❌ DOT FAILS (Error 103) WHEN:
::    - Type is hidden behind non-expandable mode
::    - Missing "Element of" quantification
::    - f declared but type not visible at use site
::
:: 🔧 FIX FOR ERROR 103:
::    1. Use "Function of A, B" directly in definition header
::    2. Or use expandable mode: "mode M is Function of A, B"
::    3. Add typed quantification: "for x being Element of A"
::    4. Ensure FUNCT_1, FUNCT_2 in notations/constructors

:: ============================================================================
:: Real-World Application: Chain Algebra (from your 4CP codebase!)
:: ============================================================================

:: This is EXACTLY the pattern from span_constructive.miz:90:
::
::   definition
::     let G be Graph, c1, c2 be Chain of G;
::     func c1 (+) c2 -> Chain of G means
::     for e being Element of the_Edges_of G holds it.e = (c1.e) (+) (c2.e);
::     existence proof ... end;
::     uniqueness;
::   end;
::
:: Why it works:
:: - e : Element of the_Edges_of G (typed quantification!)
:: - it : Chain of G (return type visible)
:: - c1, c2 : Chain of G (parameter types visible)
:: - Chain of G expands to Function type (or is used correctly)
::
:: The three dots it.e, c1.e, c2.e all work perfectly!

:: ============================================================================
:: Advanced: Multi-argument functions (from field_12.miz:1127)
:: ============================================================================

:: For binary operations, use tuples: it.(a,b) means it.[a,b]

definition
  let X be non empty set;
  let f be Function of [:X, X:], BOOLEAN;
  pred f is_symmetric means
  for x, y being Element of X holds f.(x,y) = f.(y,x);
  ::                                   ^^^^^     ^^^^^
  ::                                Tuple application!
  :: Note: f.(x,y) is sugar for f.[x,y]
