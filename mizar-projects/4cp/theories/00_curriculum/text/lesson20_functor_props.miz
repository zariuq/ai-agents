:: Commutativity of union (A \/ B = B \/ A)
theorem
  for A, B being set holds A \/ B = B \/ A
proof
  let A, B be set;
  for x being object holds (x in A \/ B iff x in B \/ A)
  proof
    let x be object;
    hereby
      assume x in A \/ B;
      then x in A or x in B by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
      then x in B or x in A;
      hence x in B \/ A by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    end;
    assume x in B \/ A;
    then x in B or x in A by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    then x in A or x in B;
    hence x in A \/ B by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
  end;
  hence thesis by TARSKI:2;
end;

:: Associativity of union ((A \/ B) \/ C = A \/ (B \/ C))
theorem
  for A, B, C being set holds (A \/ B) \/ C = A \/ (B \/ C)
proof
  let A,B,C be set;
  for x being object holds (x in (A \/ B) \/ C iff x in A \/ (B \/ C))
  proof
    let x be object;
    hereby
      assume x in (A \/ B) \/ C;
      then x in A \/ B or x in C by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
      then x in A or x in B or x in C by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
      then x in A or x in (B \/ C) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
      hence x in A \/ (B \/ C) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    end;
    assume x in A \/ (B \/ C);
    then x in A or x in (B \/ C) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    then x in A or x in B or x in C by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    then x in (A \/ B) or x in C by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    hence x in (A \/ B) \/ C by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
  end;
  hence thesis by TARSKI:2;

:: Idempotence of union (A \/ A = A)
theorem
  for A being set holds A \/ A = A
proof
  let A be set;
  for x being object holds (x in A \/ A iff x in A)
  proof
    let x be object;
    hereby
      assume x in A \/ A;
      then x in A or x in A by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
      hence x in A;
    end;
    assume x in A;
    then x in A \/ A by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    hence x in A \/ A;
  end;
  hence thesis by TARSKI:2;
