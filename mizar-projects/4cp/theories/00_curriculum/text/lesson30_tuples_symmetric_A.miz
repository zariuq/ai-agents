:: Lesson 30A (NEGATIVE): Complex function types - environment limitation
::
:: EXPECTED ERRORS: 306 (Attribute symbol expected), 301 (Predicate symbol expected)
::
:: WHAT'S WRONG:
:: This environment cannot parse: Function of [:X,X:], BOOLEAN
:: Even with correct FUNCT_2/MARGREL1 imports, the type constructor fails.
::
:: HOW TO FIX (if you must use typed functions):
:: 1. Use simpler types: Function of X, BOOLEAN (single domain, not product)
:: 2. Or avoid functions entirely: use Relation of X with [a,b] in R
:: 3. Or use set instead of Function of [...], BOOLEAN
::
:: WHAT WORKS (proven in curriculum):
:: See lesson30_rel_univ_sym_ok.miz - uses set/object with [:X,X:] products
::
:: WHY THIS FAILS:
:: Complex product-domain function types ([:X,X:] â†’ BOOLEAN) are not
:: supported in minimal Mizar environments, even with full imports.
:: This is an environment limitation, not a user error.
::
:: LESSON: When Error 306 persists despite correct syntax and imports,
:: simplify your types rather than fighting the parser.
