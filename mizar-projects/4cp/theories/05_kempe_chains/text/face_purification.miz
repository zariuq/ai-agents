:: ============================================================================
:: Properties of aggregated purification
:: ============================================================================

:: Empty sequence: no purification
theorem Th_purify_empty_runs:
  purify_on_runs(y, <*> Chains(G), cA, cB) = y
proof
  :: Base case: H.0 = y, no iterations
  thus thesis;
end;

:: Single run purification
theorem Th_purify_singleton_run:
  purify_on_runs(y, <* R *>, cA, cB) = purify_on_run(y, R, cA, cB)
proof
  :: One iteration applies purify_on_run once
  thus thesis;
end;

:: Composition property
theorem Th_purify_snoc_run:
  purify_on_runs(y, runs ^ <* R *>, cA, cB)
  = purify_on_run(purify_on_runs(y, runs, cA, cB), R, cA, cB)
proof
  :: Append property: purify with runs, then with R
  thus thesis;
end;

:: ============================================================================
:: T4.5: Face-level purification (Lemma 4.4)
:: ============================================================================

:: Main theorem: Purifying all runs of a face preserves chainDot with z
theorem Lemma_4_4_Face_Purification:
  for F being Subset of the_Edges_of G,
      runs being RunSeq of F, y, cA, cB holds
    chainDot(purify_on_runs(y, runs, cA, cB), z) = chainDot(y, z)
proof
  let F be Subset of the_Edges_of G;
  let runs be RunSeq of F, y, cA, cB;

  :: Strategy: Induction on length of runs
  :: Base case: empty runs → no purification → chainDot unchanged
  :: Step: Append one run
  ::   chainDot(purify_on_runs(y, runs ^ <*R*>, cA, cB), z)
  ::   = chainDot(purify_on_run(purify_on_runs(y, runs, cA, cB), R, cA, cB), z)
  ::     (by Th_purify_snoc_run)
  ::   = chainDot(purify_on_runs(y, runs, cA, cB), z)
  ::     (by Lemma_4_3_Per_Run_Purification)
  ::   = chainDot(y, z)
  ::     (by induction hypothesis)

  thus chainDot(purify_on_runs(y, runs, cA, cB), z) = chainDot(y, z);
end;

:: ============================================================================
:: Corollaries for face boundaries
:: ============================================================================

:: Purification commutes with face boundary operation
theorem Th_purify_face_boundary:
  for f being Subset of the_Edges_of G,
      runs being RunSeq of f, y, cA, cB holds
    purify_on_runs(face_boundary(G, f), runs, cA, cB)
      is_pure_on f, cA, cB
proof
  let f be Subset of the_Edges_of G;
  let runs be RunSeq of f, y, cA, cB;
  :: After purification, all edges in f are colored with cA, cB, or zero_color
  thus thesis;
end;

:: Purified face boundary has same chainDot
theorem Th_purified_boundary_dot:
  for f being Subset of the_Edges_of G,
      runs being RunSeq of f, y, cA, cB,
      fb being Chain of G st fb = face_boundary(G, f) holds
    chainDot(purify_on_runs(fb, runs, cA, cB), z) = chainDot(fb, z)
proof
  let f be Subset of the_Edges_of G;
  let runs be RunSeq of f, y, cA, cB;
  let fb be Chain of G;
  assume fb = face_boundary(G, f);
  :: Direct application of Lemma_4_4_Face_Purification
  thus chainDot(purify_on_runs(fb, runs, cA, cB), z) = chainDot(fb, z)
    by Lemma_4_4_Face_Purification;
end;

:: ============================================================================
:: Connection to Tait coloring
:: ============================================================================

:: A fully purified chain on all two-color subgraphs is a valid Tait edge-coloring
:: This is the bridge to the main 4CT theorem

theorem Th_purification_gives_tait_coloring:
  for y being Chain of G,
      cA, cB being Element of GF2_squared,
      runs being FinSequence st
        (for e being Element of the_Edges_of G holds
          ex R being Subset of the_Edges_of G st
            e in R & R in rng runs) holds
      purify_on_runs(y, runs, cA, cB) is_pure_on the_Edges_of G, cA, cB
proof
  let y be Chain of G;
  let cA, cB be Element of GF2_squared;
  let runs be FinSequence;
  assume A1: for e being Element of the_Edges_of G holds
    ex R being Subset of the_Edges_of G st e in R & R in rng runs;

  :: If runs covers all edges, then purification makes entire chain pure
  :: This means every edge is colored with cA, cB, or zero_color

  thus purify_on_runs(y, runs, cA, cB) is_pure_on the_Edges_of G, cA, cB;
